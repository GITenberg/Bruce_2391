description: As a respected dog breeder whose famed collie line is still winning awards
  today, Albert Payson Terhune knew the value of a perfect canine specimen whose attributes
  were sure to win plaudits at the top shows. But as a tenderhearted dog lover, Terhune
  recognized that all pups--not just the pretty ones--offer something of value to
  their owners. This fantastically action-packed novel centers on Bruce, a collie
  that wasn't blue-ribbon material, but whose loyalty and bravery mattered more.
